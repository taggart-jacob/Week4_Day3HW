# Week4_Day3HW

Problem:

1. Create an application to use 5 systems broadcasts
2. Create a foreground service with notification. Clicking on the notification will stop the foreground music. 
3. Create an IntentService to create a list of random objects (The objects should have atleast 4 fields including an image). Populate the recyclerView in the same activity which starts the intent service. Pass the data using a broadcast receiver.
4. Use the AlarmManager to send a notification after 5 secs on clicking each list item. The notification should have the object that was clicked on

Solution:

Screenshots not uploaded yet because some System Receivers don't work on the computer's emulator. All work on my phone's emulator, but am in an extreme time crunch. Will update upon project completion.

So far number one is complete and number two is getting near completion (I would think). I plan on working more on this in the next day.
